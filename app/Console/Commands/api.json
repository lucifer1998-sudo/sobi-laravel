Thankful for the washer and dryer! We did day trips outside of the city so it was nice to have free parking but we also did days in the city as well and it was nice being close to the T. We have a 4 year old so we chose to drive down to the station and park (only $7 for all day) but it’s definitely walkable for adults. The neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful; only thing I’d mention is the house is on a busy street and with that, there’s road noise. We sleep with a sound machine though so we slept peacefully. Communication with Charles was great, thanks again!",
